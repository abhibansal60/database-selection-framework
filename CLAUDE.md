# Database Selection Framework Project
## MongoDB vs PostgreSQL Decision Framework

> **Project Goal**: Build a refined decision framework that helps choose between MongoDB and PostgreSQL, with clear reasoning and team consensus capabilities.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Project Requirements

### Core Objective
**Build a framework** (NOT make a decision) that:
- Asks the RIGHT questions (refined, not hundreds)
- Provides clear MongoDB vs PostgreSQL recommendation
- Generates decision rationale in ADR-like format
- Enables team consensus and stakeholder buy-in
- Explains WHY and HOW the decision was made

### Context & Background

**Migration Journey:**
- **Current State**: SharePoint-based approach (legacy)
- **Attempted Solution**: previous platform evaluation (6-7 months)
- **previous platform Failure**: Customization limitations + maintenance overhead warnings
- **Chosen Path**: Custom application development

**Key previous platform Pain Points:**
1. **Out-of-box rigidity** - Had to use standard workflows
2. **Customization warnings** - Team advised against customizations due to maintenance burden
3. **Service Portfolio Management (business logic)** - Couldn't implement required business logic
4. **Platform limitations** - Unable to adapt to actual business needs

### Framework Requirements

**Decision Scope:**
- **ONLY MongoDB vs PostgreSQL** (not other databases)
- Custom application backing (not platform evaluation)
- Enterprise context with team decision-making

**Framework Characteristics:**
- **Refined questioning** - Ask only essential decision-driving questions
- **Smooth experience** - Not too heavy, efficient process
- **Team-oriented** - Help convince team and leverage team knowledge
- **Documentation-ready** - Generate ADR or similar decision documentation
- **Rationale-focused** - Clear WHY and HOW reasoning

**Output Format:**
- Preference for ADR (Architecture Decision Record) style
- Clear tradeoffs presentation
- Team-shareable decision documentation
- Stakeholder-friendly rationale

### Technical Context

**Primary Concerns (Informed by previous platform Experience):**
1. **Customization Freedom** - Must avoid another "previous platform situation"
2. **Schema Evolution** - Ability to change data structures without platform constraints
3. **Business Logic Implementation** - No limitations on complex requirements
4. **Long-term Maintenance** - Sustainable development and operations
5. **Team Expertise Leverage** - Use existing team knowledge effectively

**Migration Considerations:**
- Moving away from SharePoint data patterns
- Enterprise integration requirements (assumed)
- Custom application development approach
- Team consensus and buy-in critical

## ðŸŽ¯ Framework Design Approach

### Potential Framework Strategies
1. **Progressive Interview** - Core questions branch into specific areas
2. **Factor Matrix** - Weighted scoring of key decision factors  
3. **Scenario-Based** - Present archetypal situations for identification

### Key Decision Factors (To Be Refined)
- **Flexibility vs Structure** (previous platform trauma response)
- **Query Complexity Requirements**
- **Team Expertise and Learning Curve**
- **Integration and Ecosystem Needs**
- **Performance and Scale Expectations**
- **Long-term Maintenance Considerations**

### Success Criteria
- Framework generates clear recommendation with confidence level
- Decision rationale convincing to technical team
- Documentation suitable for stakeholder communication
- Process efficient enough for practical use
- Addresses "why not another platform" question proactively

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (For Tomorrow's Session)

1. **Refine Framework Architecture**
   - Choose questioning strategy (progressive vs matrix vs scenario)
   - Define decision factors and weightings
   - Design output format and templates

2. **Implement Framework Logic**
   - Build question flow and branching logic
   - Create scoring/recommendation algorithms  
   - Generate ADR template system

3. **Validate Against Context**
   - Test against previous platform pain points
   - Ensure team consensus capabilities
   - Verify stakeholder communication readiness

4. **Create Deliverable**
   - Interactive framework tool or structured questionnaire
   - ADR generation capability
   - Team decision documentation

## ðŸ’¼ Business Context Notes

**Team Decision Dynamics:**
- Need framework to facilitate team input and consensus
- Must leverage existing team knowledge and expertise
- Decision documentation for future reference and onboarding

**Stakeholder Communication:**
- Framework should generate stakeholder-friendly rationale
- Clear explanation of WHY this database choice
- HOW the decision process led to recommendation

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Avoid another "previous platform situation" of platform limitations
- Ensure long-term customization and maintenance viability
- Validate against actual business requirements (not theoretical)

---

**Priority**: Build the framework first, make decisions second. Focus on methodology and process that leads to confident, well-documented database choices.
