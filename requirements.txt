# Database Selection Framework Dependencies
# 
# This framework uses only Python standard library modules for maximum portability
# and to avoid dependency management issues (learning from previous platform complexity)

# No external dependencies required!
# 
# The framework intentionally uses only built-in Python modules:
# - json (for session storage)
# - datetime (for timestamps)
# - os, sys (for file operations)
# - dataclasses (for structured data)
# - typing (for type hints)
# - enum (for choice definitions)
#
# This design choice ensures:
# 1. Easy deployment without dependency conflicts
# 2. No version compatibility issues
# 3. Minimal maintenance burden
# 4. Fast startup and execution
# 5. No external service dependencies

# For development/testing (optional):
# pytest>=6.0.0
# mypy>=0.910
