# ADR: Database Selection - PostgreSQL for Product Catalog

## Status

**Accepted** - 2025-09-10

Confidence Level: **High confidence**

## Context

### Project Background
We are developing a custom application for Product Catalog, moving away from our previous SharePoint-based approach after  platform evaluation.

### previous platform experience & Lessons Learned
After 6-7 months of platform evaluation, we encountered critical limitations:

- **platform rigidity**: Standard workflows couldn't accommodate our business requirements
- **platform limitations**: platform constrained customizations due to maintenance burden
- **business logic implementation Limitations**: Unable to implement required business logic to the full extenst with out our own customisations
- **Platform Constraints**: Fundamental inability to adapt to actual business needs

These experiences have shaped our database selection criteria, emphasizing:
- **Customization Freedom**: Must avoid platform constraints that limit business logic implementation
- **Schema Evolution**: Ability to change data structures without platform limitations  
- **Long-term Maintenance**: Sustainable development approach without vendor lock-in risks
- **Team Control**: Full ownership of technology decisions and implementation approaches

### Technical Requirements Context
**Schema Evolution Requirements**: Somewhat predictable - Some changes expected but within known patterns

### Team Context  
**Team Expertise**: Mixed skills across different database technologies

### Decision Scope
This decision specifically addresses **database technology selection** (MongoDB vs PostgreSQL) for the custom application backend. The choice directly impacts our ability to avoid the previous platform rigidity issues while maintaining development velocity and long-term sustainability.

## Decision

**We will use PostgreSQL as the primary database for Product Catalog.**

### Scoring Summary
- **MongoDB Score**: 0.35 (23.3%)
- **PostgreSQL Score**: 1.15 (76.7%)
- **Confidence Level**: High confidence

- **Response**: Mixed skills across different database technologies
- **MongoDB Impact**: 0.10
- **PostgreSQL Impact**: 0.10
- **Rationale**: Balanced skills allow either choice
#### How critical are ACID transactions and strong consistency for your use case? (Weight: 15%)
- **Response**: Important - User data integrity matters but some flexibility acceptable
- **MongoDB Impact**: 0.00
- **PostgreSQL Impact**: 0.15
- **Rationale**: Strong consistency preferences favor PostgreSQL
#### What is your expected performance and scaling profile? (Weight: 15%)
- **Response**: Read-heavy with analytical workloads and complex queries
- **MongoDB Impact**: 0.00
- **PostgreSQL Impact**: 0.15
- **Rationale**: Read-heavy analytical workloads suit PostgreSQL
#### How complex are your typical join operations? (Weight: 2%)
- **Response**: 4-6 table joins with some complexity
- **MongoDB Impact**: 0.00
- **PostgreSQL Impact**: 0.00
- **Rationale**: Response not found in scoring matrix

### previous platform experience Impact Analysis

Our platform evaluation failure directly influenced this database selection:

#### Customization Freedom Priority
The previous platform team's warnings about customization maintenance burden highlighted the importance of technology choices that provide maximum implementation flexibility without platform constraints.

#### Schema Evolution Lessons
previous platform's rigid data model structure prevented implementation of our business logic implementation requirements. This experience prioritizes database technologies that allow business logic evolution without platform limitations.

#### Long-term Maintenance Considerations  
The previous platform maintenance burden warnings emphasized the importance of technology choices where we maintain full control over customization and evolution paths.

This database decision directly addresses these concerns by prioritizing flexibility, customization freedom, and team control over the technology stack.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences  
- **ACID Guarantees**: Strong consistency and transaction support
- **Query Power**: Complex analytical queries and joins natively supported
- **SQL Familiarity**: Leverages existing team SQL knowledge
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Rich tooling and extensive community support
- **JSON Support**: Modern PostgreSQL provides document capabilities when needed

### Negative Consequences & Mitigations
- **Schema Rigidity**: Changes require migrations
  - *Mitigation*: Careful initial design and incremental migration strategies
- **Scaling Complexity**: Vertical scaling limitations
  - *Mitigation*: Modern PostgreSQL scaling solutions and read replicas
- **previous platform Similarity Concerns**: Structured approach may feel constraining
  - *Mitigation*: PostgreSQL's flexibility far exceeds previous platform's limitations

## Implementation Notes

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Technology Spike**: Create proof-of-concept with PostgreSQL using core data models
2. **Team Onboarding**: Plan training and knowledge transfer for PostgreSQL-specific patterns
3. **Infrastructure Planning**: Define hosting, backup, and monitoring strategies
4. **Development Standards**: Establish coding standards and best practices
5. **Migration Strategy**: Plan data migration from current SharePoint system

### PostgreSQL-Specific Implementation Considerations
- **Schema Design**: Define table structures with future evolution in mind
- **Migration Framework**: Set up migration tools and processes
- **Performance Optimization**: Plan indexing strategy and query optimization approaches
- **JSON Usage**: Define patterns for leveraging PostgreSQL's JSON capabilities
- **Connection Pooling**: Implement efficient connection management

### Team Consensus & Communication
- **Decision Documentation**: This ADR serves as the formal decision record
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Share rationale with project stakeholders
- **Team Buy-in**: Ensure all team members understand and support the decision
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Plan internal presentations on chosen technology

### Success Metrics
- Development velocity maintained or improved compared to current system
- Schema evolution handled smoothly without previous platform-style constraints
- Team productivity and satisfaction with technology choice
- Successful migration from SharePoint with improved functionality

## Alternatives Considered

### Database Options Evaluated
This decision framework specifically focused on **MongoDB vs PostgreSQL** as the finalist options after broader technology evaluation.

#### MongoDB
- **Strengths**: Schema flexibility, horizontal scaling, JSON-native development
- **Weaknesses**: Limited join support, eventual consistency model
- **Score**: 0.35

#### PostgreSQL  
- **Strengths**: ACID compliance, complex query support, SQL familiarity
- **Weaknesses**: Schema migration complexity, vertical scaling limitations
- **Score**: 1.15

### Previously Rejected Options
- **previous platform**: Rejected after 6-7 months due to platform rigidity and customization limitations, which are key to our usecase
- **SharePoint**: Current system being replaced due to functional limitations
- **Other NoSQL Options**: Not evaluated in detail as MongoDB represents the document database category
- **Other SQL Options**: PostgreSQL selected as representative of modern relational databases

### Why Not Other Databases?
- **MySQL**: PostgreSQL chosen for superior JSON support and advanced features
- **Oracle/SQL Server**: Licensing costs and complexity outweigh benefits for this project  
- **DynamoDB/CosmosDB**: Vendor lock-in concerns after previous platform experience
- **Neo4j/Graph DBs**: Data relationships don't justify graph database complexity

The two-database comparison approach ensures focused evaluation while representing the core architectural decision: document-oriented vs relational data modeling.
